RANDOM RETWEET BOT V4

Version control on git (git is fucked)

Create react app x

PAGE LAYOUT:
- Sign in page - User creates an account or signs in, I would really like it so that it connects to metamask instead of having to create a username and password

- Accounts page - Lists all added accounts and has the ability to add new account, also has the ability to turn on notifications for when a tweet is retweeted from that account
	- the notification on your phone should have the ability to deselect the tweet straight from the home menu

- Add account page - insert the twitter handle of the account you would like to add

- Individual account page - Shows tweets that are in selection for retweets, how many times they have been retweeted, and the ability to deselect them from retweetability, ordered from most recent retweeted and then random

- add my name at the bottom of the page which links to angelorg website so people can see all my links and stuff, (make it so that when you hover the mouse over the name it shines a pearlescent pink over it 	all)

create Express server to handle all the backend x

Connect to twitter api with the scripts Iâ€™ve already written for PPL

Database to store peoples accounts connected to their metamask account (looking at mongo db)
